# Get_Next_Line

A project for Ã‰cole 42. We were tasked with creating a function that reads a line from one or more file descriptors, attributes the line as a value to a pointer that is given as a parameter and returns an int which indicates whether we successfully read a line (1), found the EOF (0) or got an error (-1).
